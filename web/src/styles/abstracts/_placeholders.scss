/*
Words of the Wise
    > Use extend on %placeholders primarily, not on actual selectors.
    > When extending classes, only extend a class with another class, 
        never a complex selector.
    > Directly extend a %placeholder as few times as possible.
    > Avoid extending general ancestor selectors (e.g. .foo .bar) 
        or general sibling selectors (e.g. .foo ~ .bar). 
        This is what causes selector explosion.
    > You should only extend selectors within the same media scope. 
        Think of a media query as another constraint.

TL/DR: If two selectors are characteristically similar, that is the 
    perfect use-case for @extend. If they are unrelated but share 
    some rules, a @mixin might suit you better.
